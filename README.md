# Fruits
This program uses the concepts of indexing, conditionals and loops to grant a certain request. There's a list of fruits and the user wants to pull out of the list only fruits that start with a vowel. The program then checks every name of every fruit in the list and separates the consonants from the vowels and then lists a specified number of fruits in the consonants list.
